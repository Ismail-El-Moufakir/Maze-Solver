## Introduction

Maze-Solver is a Python-based project designed to generate and solve mazes using various algorithms. It provides a comprehensive set of tools to create complex mazes and find solutions efficiently.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Create random mazes with adjustable with diff algorithms.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implemented algorithms include A*, and Depth-First Search.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Use reinforcement learning to solve mazes.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of maze generation and solving process.
